## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- NPM

## Philosophy

**GuitarCharts** was designed to feel like a musician's tool, not a math textbook. Minimalist, practical, and visually intuitive.

We believe that **understanding the fretboard visually** is the key to mastering guitar theory and improvisation.

## Roadmap

- ‚úÖ 1.0 Release: Basic CAGED scale visualization for key modes
- ‚è≥ Future Releases:
    - Chord charts (Major, Minor, 7th, Extensions)
    - Custom user scales
    - Advanced scale mode library (e.g., Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor)
    - Mobile-friendly optimizations
    - Save/share custom charts

## Dev Notes
- All note names internally use Unicode ‚ôØ and ‚ô≠ characters. If new platforms are targeted in the future (like legacy mobile browsers), revisit rendering compatibility.
